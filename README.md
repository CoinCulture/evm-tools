# evm-tools
A collection of tools for working with the evm

Some of these tools (`evm`, `disasm`) are forked directly from go-ethereum,
though `evm` has been modified to support persistence.

See the [analysis/guide.md](analysis/guide.md) for an extensive guide of the EVM using these tools.

# Install

Uses `glide` for dependencies: `go get github.com/Masterminds/glide`

```
glide install
make
```
